# This webiste is under construction.

I am an entomologist! I will be starting work on my doctorate with <a href="https://toussaintlab.com/">Dr. Emmanuel Toussaint</a> in Febuary 2022. I previously worked with the <a href="https://megalomyrmex.osu.edu/">Dr. Rachelle M.M. Adams</a> studying the population genetics of a new species of fungus-growing ant.

Expect to find anything about me such as research updates, personal code/programing notes, publications, film-photography, and general life updates.
