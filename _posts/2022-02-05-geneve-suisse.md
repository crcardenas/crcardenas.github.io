## Bonjour Genève, Suisse!

Jess and I have made it with white-girl (our cat!) to Genève. It was kind of mind boggling at first, but we already feel as settled in as we can be! We both miss Ternura, aka "T" so much (the dog). But she's having a blast barking at horses and hearding other dogs at my Moms little farm.

Once we have secured "logement à long terme" my Mom is going to fly me and T back to Switzerland. I was really hesitant to do this at first, because I didn't want to break up the family. But, as Jess has said, T is on a vacation at Grandmas.

I'm not really sure what to includ here to be honest. I spent the past hour and a half fighting with github to finally get the website up and running. I'd really like to tweak some of the formating issues with the rest of the website.

So for now, bonne journée et à demain.
(french is not going well!)
