This is just a small set of film photos from this past summer in Ohio that I took, most recently on my Mamiya 645. I left this camera back in Ohio for now, I'll bring it with me when I bring T home.

I'll post more photos eventually! For now I really need to find an apartment, fingers crossed that happens soon. In the mean time if anyone wants to send me a wider angle lens for either my Mamiya 645 or C330 (both are 80mm) man that would be nice! ;)
